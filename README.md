# Self Driving Car 

In this project we have added a Neural network and some set up to play with the modules and see how neural networs work.

> AI club looks forward to When You fork it to your github and improve upon it 

All the basic physics and sensor logic are same as before, we have added some comments in the for more clarity.

## Files to play with
- In general you can use all the files to create something new.
- you only need to interact witht the constructors of the classes if you dont want to change any physics parameters. (read comments for more info on this)
- the files car.js, sensor.js, road.js have classes that create those objects that interact with the world so make changes to see interesting results.
- The main.js file is where you can try out changing traffic, number of cars and the road.
- In the constructor of the Car class you can add more layers to the NN and create better shapes etc


#### This file also had car image that makes animation look better (but also makes rendering a bit slower) which is not included in other branches

### check out the other branches like 
- Boilerplate -> only the car game code to use for other project ideas  
- RandomTraffic -> generate new traffic automatically to avoid overfitting
