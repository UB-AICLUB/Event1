# Self Driving Car 
> with more sensors and Randomly generating traffic

In this part of the project we have added Traffic that generates randomly so our self driving car is not fit to the same old traffic and wont crash into new traffic after it is trained.

> AI club looks forward to When You fork it to your github and improve upon it 

All the basic physics and sensor logic are same as before, we have added some comments in the for more clarity.

## Files to play with
- In general you can use all the files to create something new.
- you only need to interact witht the constructors of the classes if you dont want to change any physics parameters. (read comments for more info on this)
- the files car.js, sensor.js, road.js have classes that create those objects that interact with the world so make changes to see interesting results.
- The main.js file is where you can try out changing traffic, number of cars and the road.
- In the constructor of the Car class you can add more layers to the NN and create better shapes etc
